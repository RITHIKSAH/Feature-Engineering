    "## **Feature Selection and Classifier Optimization**\n",
    "**Feature Selection** : Feature selection plays a vital role in reducing dimensionality and retaining the most relevant features for classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook mostly focuses on developing a robust machine learning pipeline to classify data using different classifiers and feature selection methods. The pipeline employs cross-validation to evaluate performance and fine-tuning to optimize models for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Project Steps and Tasks**\n",
    "**1. Data Loading and Preprocessing**\n",
    "- Files Used:\n",
    " - data.csv: Contains the feature matrix.\n",
    " - labels.csv: Contains corresponding labels for classification.\n",
    " - feature_names.csv: Includes names of features for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing:**\n",
    "- Standardized the features using StandardScaler and saved the scaler for future use (scaler.pkl).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a subjects array to group data for **Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO)** cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented four feature selection methods to reduce dimensionality and retain the most relevant features:\n",
    "- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: Used f_classif to select features based on statistical significance.\n",
    "- **Mutual Information**: Assessed mutual dependencies using mutual_info_classif.\n",
    "- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Iteratively eliminated less significant features using a linear SVM.\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression**: Utilized Lasso's feature importance (non-zero coefficients) to identify top features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Classifiers:**\n",
    "- Employed two classifiers for the classification task:\n",
    "  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Implemented with a linear kernel and probability estimation.\n",
    "  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Configured with 3 neighbors as the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cross-Validation**\n",
    "- **Method:**\n",
    "  - **Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO)** cross-validation to evaluate model performance while accounting for subject-specific data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metrics Calculated**:\n",
    "  - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.\n",
    "  - **Sensitivity (Recall)**: Ability to correctly identify positive labels.\n",
    "  - S**pecificity**: Ability to correctly identify negative labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Hyperparameter Tuning**\n",
    "  - Used **GridSearchCV** to fine-tune hyperparameters for SVM and KNN.\n",
    "  - **SVM**: Optimized parameters such as C, kernel, and gamma.\n",
    "  - **KNN**: Tuned parameters such as n_neighbors, weights, and p (distance metric).\n",
    "  - Replaced default classifiers with the fine-tuned models for subsequent evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Performance Evaluation**\n",
    "  - Compared feature selection methods and classifiers in two scenarios:\n",
    "  - Before Fine-Tuning: Evaluated raw models.\n",
    "  - After Fine-Tuning: Evaluated tuned models.\n",
    "  - Visualized performance using bar plots of accuracy scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Best Model Selection**\n",
    "- Identified the best-performing combination of:\n",
    "- Feature Selection Method.\n",
    "- Classifier.\n",
    "- Selection was based on a chosen metric (Accuracy, Sensitivity, or Specificity).\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Results:**\n",
    "  - Comparison Before and After Fine-Tuning:\n",
    "  - Fine-tuned classifiers showed improved accuracy and sensitivity.\n",
    "  - **Best Model:**\n",
    "    - Feature Selection Method: Best_Method_Name\n",
    "    - Classifier: Best_Classifier_Name\n",
    "\n",
    "#**Deliverables:**\n",
    "  - **Results:**\n",
    "    - feature_selection_results.csv: Performance metrics for all configurations.\n",
    "  - **Visualization:**\n",
    "    - Bar plots comparing classifier performance before and after fine-tuning.\n",
    "  - **Best Model:**\n",
    "    - Details of the best-performing model and feature selection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This pipeline can be extended to include additional classifiers, feature selection methods, or new datasets.\n"
